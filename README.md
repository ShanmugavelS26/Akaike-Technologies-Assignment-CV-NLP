1. CV

The objective of this assignment is to develop a solution using image processing techniques to partially de-annotate an image, given an original image and a fully annotated image. The solution should be able to de annotate the image partially without re-annotating the original image. The assignment will also provide a set of sample images containing original, fully annotated, and partially annotated images for testing and evaluation purposes.The solution should be able to identify and remove specific annotations from the fully annotated image while preserving the underlying information of the original image. The partially de-annotated image should not contain any unwanted annotations or distortions that may affect its interpretation. Additionally, the solution should be able to generalize to different types ofimages and annotations, and should be efficient and scalable for processing large datasets.

2. NLP

The goal of this internship assignment is to test your proficiency in natural language processing. You will be tasked with developing a solution that can automatically generate objective questions with multiple correct answers based on a given chapter from a subject. The generated questions should test the reader's understanding of the chapter and have more than one possible correct answer to increase the complexity and challenge of the questions.The generated questions should not only test the reader's comprehension of the chapter but also encourage them to think beyond the surface level and explore different perspectives and possibilities. Ultimately, the objective of this project is to develop a robust and accurate solution that can aid educators in creating engaging and challenging assessments for their students.
